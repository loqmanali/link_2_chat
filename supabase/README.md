## Features

The Supabase integration provides:

- User authentication and management
- Cloud database for phone entries and analytics
- Team management and sharing
- API key generation and management
- Real-time sync for offline support

## Database Schema

- **users**: Extends Supabase's auth.users table with application-specific user data
- **phone_entries**: Stores the WhatsApp/Telegram links with associated metadata
- **teams**: Supports team feature with roles and permissions
- **team_members**: Manages team membership
- **api_keys**: Allows generation and management of API keys

## Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS policies set up to ensure users can only access their own data, or data shared with them via teams.

## Real-time Sync

Supabase's real-time feature is enabled for phone_entries, teams, and team_members tables to support real-time updates across devices.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Supabase integration:

1. Check that your Supabase URL and anon key are correct
2. Verify that the database schema was applied correctly
3. Check the Flutter app logs for connectivity or authentication errors
4. Ensure that Row Level Security policies are correctly applied
